# GCR Amazon ECS Workshop 

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. There are 2 cluster launch types:
1. Fargate: Host the cluster as serverless approach that is managed by Amazon ECS. You only need focus on launching your services or tasks
2. ECS on EC2. To provide more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. 

You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. 

Amazon ECS can be used to run microservices workloads, scale batch jobsï¼Œ machine learning and Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) workloads, and etc.
